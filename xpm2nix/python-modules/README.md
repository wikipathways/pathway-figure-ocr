# Dependencies from PyPi

I am using [`poetry2nix`](https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix) for this.

If you update `pyproject.toml` manually, update `poetry.lock` by running:

```
poetry lock
```

To add a new dependency:

```
poetry add --lock jupytext
```

That will add `jupytext` to `pyproject.toml` as well as `poetry.lock`.
